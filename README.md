# README

this readme can ease your pain when you are going to rename the module located in the different directory.

For instance,

`$ cp /aaa/bbb/ccc/ddd/eee.txt  /aaa/bbb/ccc/ddd/fff.txt`

is not that easy experience.

also, going to the target directory is not that nice.

You can do the same thing with this:
`$ rename /aaa/bbb/ccc/ddd/eee.txt fff.txt`

# Installation

`$ ./installer`
